# Doors

This is a take on the classic "100 Doors" problem in computer science which is a relatively simple mathematical problem. 

If you have 100 doors that are initially closed, and follow this procedure:

Walk past the doors 100 times, the first time you toggle every door (if the door is closed, you open it, and vice versa). 

The second time, you only visit every second door, the third time every third door. 

This continues until you only visit the 100th door.

I wanted to write a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript page that would actually show the doors opening and closing.

You can download the zip, unpack it, and double click on the html page to run this in your browser.

When the doors are done the numbers of the doors remaining open are displayed below the "Click This!" button.
